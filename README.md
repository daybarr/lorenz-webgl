lorenz-webgl
============

A quick hack to render the [Lorenz Attractor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) in a web browser using WebGL via [three.js](http://threejs.org/).

The result demonstrate the system's sensitivity to initial conditions - the hallmark of [chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). It does this by starting with three points that are very close together and using different colours to simultaneously plot their evolution over time. At first, the three plots are very close to each other, but after a short while they suddenly diverge and provide a good demonstration of the [Butterfly Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).

**[Run it!](http://daybarr.github.io/lorenz-webgl/index.html)**

This hack is basically a much easier to run version of [my ancient screensaver](http://www.daybarr.com/screensavers/3dlorenzattractor/) for Windows. That was written in C++ for DirectX and I've lost the sources.
